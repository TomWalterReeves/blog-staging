I’m Tom Reeves, an engineer working in energy and currently taking some time off to travel. This blog is a place to channel the energy I usually spend going down Wikipedia rabbit holes. 

I’m using it to learn new coding and data skills, explore how the energy world fits together, and share whatever interesting things I find along the way.
